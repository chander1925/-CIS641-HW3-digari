# Overview

The purpose of this document is to define the software requirements specification (SRS) for the Advanced Calculator Application. This application is developed using Python and Tkinter, providing both basic arithmetic and scientific calculation functionalities, including trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. The requirements outlined in this document aim to ensure the calculator is user-friendly, responsive, and meets functional and non-functional expectations.

# Functional Requirements

## Basic Arithmetic Operations
1. **FR1:** The calculator shall perform addition when the "+" button is pressed.
2. **FR2:** The calculator shall perform subtraction when the "-" button is pressed.
3. **FR3:** The calculator shall perform multiplication when the "*" button is pressed.
4. **FR4:** The calculator shall perform division when the "/" button is pressed.
5. **FR5:** The calculator shall display the result on the screen after the "=" button is pressed.

## Scientific Functions
1. **FR6:** The calculator shall allow users to calculate the sine of an angle using the "SIN" button.
2. **FR7:** The calculator shall allow users to calculate the cosine of an angle using the "COS" button.
3. **FR8:** The calculator shall allow users to calculate the tangent of an angle using the "TAN" button.
4. **FR9:** The calculator shall allow users to calculate hyperbolic sine using the "SINH" button.
5. **FR10:** The calculator shall allow users to calculate hyperbolic cosine using the "COSH" button.

## User Interface (UI)
1. **FR11:** The calculator shall have a clear button "C" that resets the current input.
2. **FR12:** The calculator shall support both keyboard and mouse input for all operations.
3. **FR13:** The calculator shall display the current operation and input on the screen in real time.

# Non-Functional Requirements

## Performance
1. **NFR1:** The calculator shall respond to user input within 0.5 seconds to ensure smooth performance.
2. **NFR2:** The calculator shall accurately perform calculations with up to 10 decimal places of precision.

## Usability
1. **NFR3:** The user interface shall be intuitive and designed in such a way that users with minimal technical knowledge can operate the calculator.
2. **NFR4:** The calculator's buttons and screen shall be responsive across different screen sizes.

## Portability
1. **NFR5:** The calculator shall run on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems without modifications.

## Reliability
1. **NFR6:** The calculator shall maintain functionality even after multiple operations are performed in succession without requiring a restart.
2. **NFR7:** The application shall handle invalid inputs gracefully and notify the user when an error occurs.

# Traceability

This document is designed to ensure traceability of requirements for the Advanced Calculator Application. Each requirement is mapped to a specific feature or function of the calculator, ensuring full coverage of the intended features and behaviors.
